## FAQ

#### What are alternatives to canvas-sketch?

p5.js community is a wonderful one and it's good to mention like canvas-sketch this one is an abstraction on top of canvas API.

#### Why not using pure canvas API?

That's a good choice to start learning and digging into the rabbit hole but for a good development experience you may use some abstraction and utils these tools provide you out of the box.


## Installation

Install dependencies with npm

```bash
# Install the CLI tool globally
npm install canvas-sketch-cli -g
cd Sana
canvas-sketch sana --output=pathToOutput
```

After launching the last command canvas-sketch will give you a URL to start your journey.
